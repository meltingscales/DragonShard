## ðŸš§ Next Steps - Phase 3: Fuzzing
The next major milestone is implementing the fuzzing module. This will include:

### Core Fuzzing Components
- **fuzzer.py**: Main fuzzing engine with payload testing
- **mutators.py**: Payload mutation strategies
- **payloads.json**: Comprehensive payload library
- **anomaly_detector.py**: Detection of unusual responses

### Planned Features
- XSS payload testing and detection
- SQL injection testing and detection
- Command injection testing
- Path traversal testing
- Custom payload mutation strategies
- Response analysis and anomaly detection
- Crash logging and reporting
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Implementation Priority
1. **Basic fuzzer.py** with simple payload testing
2. **payloads.json** with common attack vectors
3. **Response analysis** for detecting vulnerabilities
4. **Mutation strategies** for payload variation
5. **Integration with crawler** for automatic endpoint discovery
6. **Comprehensive testing** and documentation


# Extra ideas

- dynamic fuzz payload generator (AI? genetic algorithms? both?)
