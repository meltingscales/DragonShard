# Extra ideas

- Can we make a separate visualization that shows the full tree of mutations?
- Make frontend and api used for the entire project, not just viz
- let's use a database backend instead of an in-memory store.
- I don't want to just simulate fuzzing. Make the fuzzing web UI and API actually fuzz.
- In the web UI, move the visualizations to their own sub-page, like `/visualizations`, and make a homepage. Also, make a navbar that's the same across all pages and make a homepage.
